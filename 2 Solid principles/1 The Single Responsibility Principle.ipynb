    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### FighterJet Class: \n",
    "\n",
    "Responsible for the overall management of the fighter jet. It delegates specific tasks (like operating the engine and managing the weapon system) to other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Engine Class:\n",
    "Responsible for all engine-related operations. Its sole reason to change would be if something about the engine's operation needs to be altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### WeaponSystem Class:\n",
    "Responsible for managing the weapons. This includes loading, aiming, and firing the weapons. Any change in how the weapon system operates would only affect this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, each class has a single responsibility, and therefore only one reason to change. The FighterJet class is not concerned with how the engine operates or how the weapons are managed; it simply uses these functionalities. Similarly, the Engine and WeaponSystem classes are focused on their respective areas.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### points\n",
    "Following the Single Responsibility Principle helps in making the code more maintainable and understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each class has a clearly defined role, making it easier to manage and modify the code in the future.\n",
    "Changes in one part of the system are less likely to impact other parts, reducing the risk of bugs and unintended consequences when modifications are made."
