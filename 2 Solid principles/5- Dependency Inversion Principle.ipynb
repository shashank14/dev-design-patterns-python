    "The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) emphasizes that both high-level and low-level modules should depend on abstractions rather than concrete details.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Let's clarify how\n",
    "NotificationManager (a high-level module) depends on the IMessageService (an abstraction) in the provided example:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Dependency:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Abstraction (IMessageService):\n",
    "\n",
    "MessageService is an abstract class that defines a send_message method. It's an abstraction because it doesn't contain any specific implementation details; it just provides a generic interface for sending messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Low-Level Modules\n",
    "Definition: Low-level modules are closer to the concrete implementation details and data. They handle specific tasks and have detailed knowledge about how certain operations are carried out.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### High-Level Module (NotificationManager):\n",
    "\n",
    "NotificationManager is designed to manage notifications. It needs a way to send these notifications, but instead of directly using a specific service like EmailService or SMSService, it relies on the MessageService interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dependency on Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "When we instantiate NotificationManager, we pass in an object that implements the IMessageService interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be an EmailService, SMSService, or any other service that follows the IMessageService interface.\n",
    "By programming to the IMessageService interface, NotificationManager does not need to know the specifics of how messages are sent. It only knows that it can call send_message on the service it has been given.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This design means NotificationManager is dependent on the MessageService abstraction, not on the concrete details of email or SMS sending.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Revisited:\n",
    "When we create a NotificationManager, we inject a MessageService:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "The classification into high-level and low-level modules helps in designing systems that are loosely coupled and more maintainable. High-level modules contain business logic and decision-making, while low-level modules handle the specifics of data handling, communication, or other detailed operations. This separation allows for flexibility, as changing the concrete implementations in low-level modules doesnâ€™t affect the high-level modules, provided the interfaces remain consistent.\n",
