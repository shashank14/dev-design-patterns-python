    "The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is a concept in object-oriented programming that forms a part of the SOLID principles. It states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, a subclass should override the parent class methods in a way that does not break functionality from a client's point of view.\n"

    "###### Violation of LSP: \n",
    "In this example, substituting a Rectangle object with a Square object leads to unexpected behavior. \n",
    "Setting the width and height independently for a square doesn't make sense as it violates the definition of a square.\n",
    "\n",

    "###### Consequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "This violation leads to incorrect behavior when Square objects are used in contexts designed for Rectangle objects.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Correct Approach Following LSP:\n",
    "To adhere to LSP, Square and Rectangle should not have an inheritance relationship if their behaviors are fundamentally different in certain contexts. They could implement a common interface or be completely separate classes without a parent-child relationship.\n",
