    "##### conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "Factory Method pattern allows you to create objects belonging to a similar family (transport vehicles) with different implementations by defining a common interface for creating objects, while letting subclasses determine the type of objects that will be created. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### idea \n",
    "The key idea behind this pattern is to allow a class to defer object instantiation/creation to its subclasses. This way, the superclass is not tightly coupled to the concrete classes it must create and can remain more generic and\n",
    "focused on broader behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subclasses take on the responsibility of deciding the specifics of the object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Common Interface for Object Creation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern starts with a common interface or an abstract class that defines a method for creating objects. In the context of transport vehicles, this could be an abstract LogisticsCompany class with a method like create_transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Subclass Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Subclasses of this abstract class then implement the creation method to create specific types of objects. For instance, RoadLogistics may implement create_transport to create a Truck object, while SeaLogistics creates a Ship object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Encapsulation of Object Creation Logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each subclass encapsulates the logic and details of creating its specific type of object. This means the creation process can vary widely between subclasses, while the client code that uses these objects remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Client Code Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The client code interacts with the abstract class or interface, not with the concrete subclass. This means the client code can work with any subclass without knowing its specific implementation. For example, it can call create_transport on a LogisticsCompany reference, not knowing if it's dealing with RoadLogistics or SeaLogistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Adding New Types of Transport Vehicles:\n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce a new type of transport vehicle, you can simply add a new subclass that implements the creation method. For example, if you want to add air transport, you create an AirLogistics class that returns an Airplane object in its create_transport method. This is done without modifying existing subclasses or client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Flexibility and Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Factory Method pattern provides flexibility in the way objects are created and makes the system scalable. You can easily change the creation process in one place (in the subclass), and it will be reflected wherever the factory is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### This pattern is particularly useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "when the exact class of the object to be created cannot be anticipated \n",
    "\n",
    "The Factory Method pattern is particularly useful in situations where a system needs to be independent from the way its objects are created, composed, and represented. It's used when the system needs to be configured with one of multiple families of objects. Here's when to consider using this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to decouple object creation from its usage: Using this pattern allows for the instantiation process to be abstracted and hidden from the client. The client code interacts with an interface or an abstract class, and the factory handles the object creation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you need consistency among products: If you have a set of related products that are designed to be used together (like the Truck and Ship classes in the transportation example), a factory can ensure that the correct types of objects are created and that they're all compatible with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to introduce new types of products without changing existing code: The Factory Method makes your code more scalable and manageable. When you need to introduce new product types, you only need to create a new concrete factory and product class without altering the existing client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the creation process is complex: If the creation of an object involves a lot of steps or complex logic, encapsulating it in a dedicated factory method or class helps in isolating this complexity and making the code more maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Factory Method is a powerful pattern for creating objects while keeping the system flexible and maintainable. It's especially useful in large systems, complex class hierarchies, or when there's a need for dynamic, run-time decision-making about what classes to instantiate.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- or when a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates. It's also helpful when classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ##### Factory Method Pattern in Use:\n",
    "Ideal when a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create\n",
    "\n",
    "The document editor (a class) doesn't know in advance what type of document (text, spreadsheet, presentation) the user will choose to create.The types of documents that can be created might also expand in the future (e.g., adding a drawing document). -->\n"

    "##### Creating Objects with Shared Interfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have a set of objects that share a common interface, but their instantiation process differs. The Factory Method allows for the creation of these objects while hiding the complexities of their instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Dynamic and Flexible Object Creation:\n",
    "In scenarios where the object to be created might change dynamically based on the context, environment, or configuration. Factory Method allows the decision about which class to instantiate to be made at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Decoupling Client Code from Object Creation:\n",
    "When the client code should be independent of the concrete classes used to instantiate objects. This pattern helps in reducing the coupling between the client code and the classes it needs to instantiate.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Adding New Derived Classes:\n",
    "When new derived classes are added frequently, the Factory Method pattern simplifies the integration of these new classes into the system, as the client code does not need to be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### When Subclasses Must Specify Objects:\n",
    "In cases where a superclass cannot anticipate the class of objects it needs to create, and it is intended that its subclasses specify these objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Enhancing Modularity and Readability:\n",
    "The pattern is useful for enhancing the modularity of a codebase, making it more readable and maintainable, by isolating the object creation logic in separate classes or methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Testing and Mocking:\n",
    "The Factory Method pattern can be beneficial in scenarios requiring unit testing and mocking. It allows for the substitution of mock objects in place of real objects for testing purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Product Frameworks and Libraries:\n",
    "In developing libraries or frameworks where the internal details of object creation should be hidden from the users, allowing the framework to introduce new types or change the existing ones without affecting the client code."
