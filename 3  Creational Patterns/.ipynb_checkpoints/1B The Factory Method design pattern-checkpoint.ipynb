    "Applicability\n",
    "This example illustrates scenarios where the Factory Method pattern is particularly useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "Specialized Configuration: Different jet types have specific needs for engines and avionics. This pattern allows each type of jet to independently specify and create these components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex Creation Logic: If the creation of engines and avionics involves complex decision-making or configuration, encapsulating this within the subclass is beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintaining Flexibility and Extensibility: The pattern allows for easy introduction of new jet types or component types without modifying existing classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decoupling: The FighterJet superclass remains decoupled from the specific types of engines and avionics, promoting a flexible and maintainable codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world applications, the Factory Method pattern is valuable in scenarios where products or components are diverse and require specialized creation processes, as seen in different types of fighter jets and their components. This approach enables a system to be both adaptable and scalable."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "In the Factory Method pattern, it's crucial for all subclasses to implement the abstract methods defined in the superclass. Failing to do so breaks the contract established by the superclass and will result in runtime errors. This ensures consistency and enforces the implementation of all necessary components in each subclass, which is a fundamental aspect of this design pattern."
