    "### Decoupling the Sender of a Request from its Receiver\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sender (Invoker) - RemoteControl:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the class that initiates the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's responsible for executing the command but doesn't know how the command is executed or what the receiver's implementation details are. The RemoteControl class has a press_button method that takes a command and executes it, but it is completely oblivious to what the command is actually doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Receiver - Television:\n",
    "This class knows how to perform the operations (like turning on/off the TV, changing channels, adjusting volume). It contains the actual logic for the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Decoupling:\n",
    "In your code, the RemoteControl (sender/invoker) doesn't directly perform the actions on the Television (receiver). Instead, it sends commands, which are executed by the Television. This decouples the RemoteControl from the Television, meaning you can change the implementation of the Television class or replace it with another receiver without altering the RemoteControl class. Similarly, you can update or replace the RemoteControl without affecting the Television.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Parameterization of Requests\n",
    "Commands as Request Parameters: Each command (like TurnOnTVCommand, ChangeChannelCommand) encapsulates all the information needed to perform an action, including the method to call on the receiver (Television) and the parameters to pass (like channel number in ChangeChannelCommand).\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Flexibility in Execution:\n",
    "By encapsulating the request as an object, commands can be passed around and used dynamically. For instance, different commands can be assigned to the same button at different times, or the commands can be queued or logged.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example in Code:\n",
    "In tv_remote_demo, different command instances are created with specific parameters (like channel in ChangeChannelCommand(tv, 5)). These commands are then executed through the RemoteControl, demonstrating parameterization. The RemoteControl executes the command without knowing what parameters it carries or what specific action it performs on the Television.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### In summary,\n",
    "the Command pattern in your code demonstrates decoupling by separating the object that issues a request (RemoteControl) from the objects that know how to execute it (Television). It also shows parameterization by allowing requests to be encapsulated as objects (Command instances) with specific parameters and methods, making the system more flexible and extensible.\n",

    "The Command design pattern offers several significant advantages, making it a popular choice in various programming \n",
    "\n",
    "###### scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Separation of Concerns:\n",
    "It clearly separates the concerns by decoupling the object that invokes the operation (the invoker) from the one that knows how to perform it (the receiver). This separation enhances modularity and makes the code more maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Extensibility and Flexibility:\n",
    "New commands can be added without changing existing code. This makes the system more extensible and adaptable to change. For instance, adding a new command to an application does not require modifying the invoker or the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Reusability and Composability:\n",
    "Individual command objects encapsulate all details of an action and can be composed and reused throughout the application. This can simplify complex operations that might involve multiple commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Undo/Redo Functionality: \n",
    "The pattern naturally supports undo and redo operations. Since each command encapsulates an action and its reverse, implementing these functionalities becomes straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Simplifying Complex Systems:\n",
    "In systems with high levels of complexity, particularly those with numerous operations, the pattern helps in managing these operations more effectively. It does so by keeping the operational code encapsulated in separate command objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Delayed or Remote Execution:\n",
    "Commands can be queued and executed at a later time. This is useful in scenarios like thread pools, job queues, or for remote execution where commands are sent to a different context for execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Logging and Transactional Behavior:\n",
    "Since the pattern provides a central location for handling all actions or operations, it facilitates logging and transactional behaviors. You can keep a history of changes, which can be useful for auditing and transaction management.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Synchronization of Operations:\n",
    "In a multi-threaded application, you can manage synchronization and execution order of commands more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Integration with Other Patterns:\n",
    "Command works well with other design patterns. For instance, it can be used in conjunction with the Factory pattern to create commands, or with the Memento pattern for state management.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Command pattern provides a flexible way to decouple objects that execute operations from objects that know how to perform those operations. Its ability to add new commands without changing existing code, support for undo/redo operations, and other features make it a valuable pattern for complex, high-level applications.\n",
