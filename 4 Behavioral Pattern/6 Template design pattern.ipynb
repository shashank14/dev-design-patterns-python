    "Key Components:\n",
    "Abstract Template: Declares the structure of the algorithm with placeholder methods.\n",
    "Concrete Templates: Implement specific versions of the algorithm by filling in the placeholder methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Base Class (Template Class):\n",
    "\n",
    "Role: Defines the template method that outlines the structure of an algorithm. It also declares abstract methods that subclasses will implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### In Your Example:\n",
    "OrderProcessingTemplate serves as the abstract base class. It contains the template method process_order and abstract methods verify_order, assign_delivery_agent, and track_delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "######  Template Method:\n",
    "Role:A method in the abstract class that defines the skeleton of an operation in terms of a series of high-level steps. This method calls abstract methods as well as other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Your Example: The process_order method in OrderProcessingTemplate is the template method. It calls the abstract methods in a specific sequence, defining the overall process flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Abstract Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Role: Methods declared in the abstract class but not implemented. These methods are overridden by subclasses to provide specific behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Your Example: verify_order, assign_delivery_agent, and track_delivery are abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass of OrderProcessingTemplate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Concrete Subclasses:\n",
    "\n",
    "Role: Implement the abstract methods of the abstract class. Each subclass can provide a different implementation of these methods, thus varying parts of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Your Example: LocalOrderProcessor and InternationalOrderProcessor are concrete subclasses. They provide specific implementations of the abstract methods, catering to local and international order processing, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Subclass Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Role: Subclasses implement the abstract methods to complete the steps specific to their context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Your Example: Each of the concrete subclasses (LocalOrderProcessor and InternationalOrderProcessor) defines how to verify orders, assign delivery agents, and track deliveries in their respective contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Client:\n",
    "\n",
    "Role: The client uses the template class and/or its subclasses. It's responsible for creating instances of the concrete subclasses and calling their methods\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Your Example: The main function acts as the client, creating instances of LocalOrderProcessor and InternationalOrderProcessor and invoking their process_order method"
