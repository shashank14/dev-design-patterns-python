    "Role: Defines a common interface for both the real object and the proxy. This allows any client to treat the proxy and the real object interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Your Example: The Image interface with the display method is the common interface for both RealImage and ImageProxy.\n",

    "###### Real Object (RealImage):\n",
    "\n",
    "Role: The actual object that the proxy represents. This object does the real work, and its creation and access are often resource-intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Your Example: RealImage is the real object. It loads an image from disk (a potentially expensive operation) and displays it.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Proxy (ImageProxy):\n",
    "\n",
    "Role: Maintains a reference to the real object, controls access to it, and can perform additional actions (such as lazy initialization, logging, access control, etc.) before or after forwarding requests to the real object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Your Example: ImageProxy acts as a proxy for RealImage. It overrides the display method and lazily initializes RealImage upon first use. This means it delays the loading of the image from disk until absolutely necessary (i.e., when display is called).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Client (ImageDemo):\n",
    "\n",
    "Role: Interacts with the Proxy object. The client typically does not know (and should not care) whether it is working with a real object or a proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Your Example: ImageDemo class acts as the client. It creates an instance of ImageProxy and uses it, unaware of the lazy loading happening behind the scenes."
